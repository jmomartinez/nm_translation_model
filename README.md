# Neural Machine Translation Model

### Libraries Used
- Keras (Tensorflow backend): For model creation
- Sklearn: Data spliting
- cPickle: To store variables for later use
- re: For pre-processing of textual data
- Pandas & Numpy: For data visualization purpose & array casting
- matplotlib.pyplot: Result visualization

### Concepts/Frameworks Used
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encoder/Decoder LSTM Model
- Tokenization & seqence padding
- seq2seq problem

This model is capable of translating text from French to English, or vice versa with slight changes. 
The dataset for this script can be found at http://www.manythings.org/anki/, also the best_model.tf file is not included for storage purposes.

The inspiration for this model came after studying abroad in France for a year, and most recently reading an interesting blog post on Analytics Vidhya.
From this intersection I decided to custom make my own Neural Machine Translation model.
